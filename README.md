# hello-world
My first repository, perhaps where I will be adding useful resources.

Juansa here, I am learning these fancy tools for the sake of Computational Chemistry, Machine Learning and Data Science.
I find fiscinating the convergence between computers and molecules.

I just found some good resources:
1. Learning Lab: https://lab.github.com
2. GitHub Guides: https://guides.github.com

I just found some good videos:
1. Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc
2. Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk
